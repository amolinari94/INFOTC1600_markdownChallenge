### Background
My experience with programming started in the summer of 2021.  I began the [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course on 'Udemy' based on a suggestion from a close family friend.  The course is a start-to-finish [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) course, starting with basic print statements and ending on professional-level program development.  

After some of the introductory tutorials, I started with a few small coding challenges that forced me to be deliberate and thoughtful with the code I was writing.  After troubleshooting my first program, hitting **_run_**, and seeing it work properly, **I was hooked**.  I enrolled in the Bachelors of IT here at Mizzou within the month, and made the 1065-mile drive to start the semester in mid-august.

Roughly 18 months later, I'm minoring in Computer Science and working on an independent project to design a fully autonomous flight control system with Java and an open-source development toolkit provided by NASA.
