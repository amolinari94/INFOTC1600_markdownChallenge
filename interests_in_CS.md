## My Interests

I'm passionate about all programming processes and use-cases, but my primary interest lies in [Control Systems and Algorithms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/control-algorithm).  My free time and independent projects largely revolve around automation and control system design.  With a weak background in math, my strengths lie primarily in abstract concepts.  These strengths help me design algorithms that use mathematic's concepts in code, such as calculus/differential equations, that I've never come close to approaching or understanding in tradition math settings.  

Beyond algorithm design and automation, my interests are in Aerospace and Defense, Artificial Intelligence, Astronomy and Filmmaking.  All of these topics have use-cases for programming and computer science concepts, so I'm confident in my choice to pursue this field.
